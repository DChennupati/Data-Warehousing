2) Run_Create_KimballDW - This stored procedure Tables created using Kimball method Which is Star-schema.
3) ETL_Load_Inmon_Data - We first extract, transform and load the data in the Inmon tables.
4) ETL_Load_Kimball_Dimensions - We then load Kimball's dimensions tables first even before loading the Fact tables since Dimension table contains primary keys/ surrogate keys which are in turn the foreign keys in the fact tables, hence we load the parent tables first.
5) ETL_Load_Kimball_FactSales - We extract, transform and finally load the data in our FactSales table.
